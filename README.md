This is the papers we reviewed for the module 4 of the course.
I presented the Atari paper and the 2992_Generative Models What Do They Know? together with the LION paper - see ppt 

I had 2 presentations - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11opwmI63pC2UyOfzKYEvRNiKpR60cvkvsqp-0O1e1sg/mobilepresent?slide=id.SLIDES_API1000368458_0

And see the ppt. for the LION paper

Also included are a few experiments where I tried to get the ILora implementation from the LION paper to work using diffusion models with ILora and also an implementation of the famous titanic survivor kaggle dataset but solved using SIMCLR - SIMCLR is usually used with images and it was an interesting experiment to try and make it work together with a numeric categorical dataset
